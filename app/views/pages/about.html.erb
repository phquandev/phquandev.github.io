A Little About Me
I am a freelance web developer and web designer living in London, UK. I started freelancing in 2009 and have worked for a wide range of personal clients and agencies.
I offer a complete web solution to my clients. I can guide you through the early stages of project planning and research, help you with information architecture and user experience, design your website, and finally build the site for you.
